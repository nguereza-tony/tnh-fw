### Requirements 
You can use **TNH Framework** for web or command line application. For web application: 
- Any web server **(Apache, nginx, lighttp, etc.)**
- **PHP >= 5.4**, **PHP 7.4** 

For CLI application just PHP executable is needed. 

### Why another PHP Framework?
Well, I created TNH Framework for my own project, but decided to share with everyone.  
I was also tired of all those bloated PHP Framework, with steep learning curve that create another language on top of PHP. Really?!  
So this one is smaller. It is not bloated and contains some useful libraries, functions and tricks. And above all, it's damn simple.

### Installation
#### Using composer (recommended)
```bash
composer create-project tnhfw/tnh-fw --stability dev
```
#### Using GitHub releases
- Download the framework using the following link [https://github.com/tnhfw/tnh-fw/releases](https://github.com/tnhfw/tnh-fw/releases)
- Extract the downloaded file in your web directory (**www, htdocs, web, etc.)** for example **/www/tnh-fw** or using your application name **/www/my-apps**

### Launch it
Open your browser with the url like **http://localhost/tnh-fw** or **http://localhost/my-apps** change localhost with your real IP address or domain name.
